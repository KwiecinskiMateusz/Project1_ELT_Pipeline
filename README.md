# Project 1: ELT Pipeline
This project is my first portfolio piece in Data Analysis, providing hands-on experience with MySQL. The goal was to extract, load, and transform data from three raw CSV files into a structured, clean dataset ready for potential exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

**Data Sources:**
- Population data (255 countries and regions, 1960–2023)
- Average temperature data (170 countries, 1901–2022)
- Electricity production data (251 countries and regions, 1985–2023)

**Key Transformations & Feature Engineering:**
- Merged datasets into a final table covering 160 countries (2000–2022) with population, temperature, and electricity production data.
- Created additional features, including yearly changes (absolute & percentage) for all metrics.
- Added electricity production per capita as a new calculated column.
- Performed basic data aggregation for enhanced code usability.

The final dataset is export-ready in CSV format for further potential analysis and visualization.
